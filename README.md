# Hints for Magento® 1

## Overview

This extension allows you to improve the usability of your Magento store by enriching product attributes and options, in addition to product custom options through the use of descriptive tooltips/hints that work beautifully in every browser on any device. When an attribute or its option has a description, it will have an info icon created next to it in the layered navigation block as well as on the product view page and in the compare window. When you hover an icon, a tooltip will popup with a description in it.

Sometimes attribute title is not self-explanatory and you want to show a long description of the attribute or its values. This module allows you make tooltips to the attribute or its values and show it in the layered navigation, search results, and product page. Also, the extension allows you create tooltips for product's custom options. This will make meaning of the attributes and its values more clear to your customers.
